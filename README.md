# MonteCarloGlauber

[![Build Status](https://github.com/AndreasKirchner/MonteCarloGlauber.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/AndreasKirchner/MonteCarloGlauber.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

To install the package and its dependencies one can use 
```julia
import Pkg
Pkg.add(url = "https://github.com/AndreasKirchner/MonteCarloGlauber.jl")
```
After this one can use the package simply by using 
```julia
using MonteCarloGlauber
```

## Basic Expample 
```julia
using Statistics
using MonteCarloGlauber
using Plots

n1= Lead()
n2= Lead()
```
This defines the two nuclei. Asymmetric collision, e.g. Lead and Uranium are also possible. The nucleons inside the nuclei are sampled via
```julia
rand(n1)
rand(n2)
```
Each will sample a matrix $(A,2)$ where $A$ is the mass number and 2 are the x and y positions of the nucleons. To sample more configurations, one can use
```julia
rand(n1,100)
```
, which generates 100 events in a vector. 
The rand mutates the state of the nucleus, so it is generically not threadsafe. However, there exists a function that makes a copy in each thread and safely evaluates the rand on each thread. 
```julia
rand(threaded(n1),100)
```
The Monte Carlo Glauber model is specified by the parameters
```julia
w= 1
s_NN=5000
k=1
p=0.
b=(1,2)
```
To sample the event, we first create a struct 
```julia
participants=Participants(n1,n2,w,s_NN,k,p,b)
```
, in which case the impact parameter range is specified. If b is not specified, one creates minimum bias events. The minimum bias events are then sampled via
```julia
participants=threaded(Participants(n1,n2,w,s_NN,k,p))
event=rand(participants,1000)
```
With the events sampled we can now compute things such as the impact parameter histogram
```julia
b_event=map(event) do x
    impactParameter(x) 
end 
histogram(b_event,nbins=100)
```
or the histogram for the number of collisions
```julia
ncoll_event=map(event) do x
    x.n_coll
end
histogram(ncoll_event,nbins=100,yscale=:log10)
```
We can also plot the events by evaluating them on a grid
```julia
profile=map(event)   do x 
    map(Iterators.product(-10:0.5:10,-10:0.5:10)) do y
        x(y...)
    end
end
heatmap(-10:0.5:10,-10:0.5:10,profile[1])
```
It is also possible to generate the background configuration and two point correlation function used in the FluiduM code via
```julia
energy2(T)=T
bg,twpt=generate_bg_two_pt_fct(energy2,energy2,1,Lead(),Lead(),w,k,p,s_NN,[10,20],[2];minBiasEvents=1000,r_grid=0:1:10,nFields=3,n_ext_Grid=20)

```
We can also plot the background
```julia
plot(0:1:10,bg[1])
plot!(0:1:10,bg[2])
```
and the two point function
```julia
heatmap(twpt[1,1,1,1,1,:,:])
```
The usage of light ions is also possible with the only needed modification in the projectile definition
```julia
n1=TabulatedEvent("NLEFT_dmin_0.5fm_negativeweights_Ne.h5")
```
with TabulatedEvent being the file of possible neon configurations in this case.
